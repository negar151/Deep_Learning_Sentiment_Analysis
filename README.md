# https-Deep_Learning_Sentiment_Analysis
We propose deep diverse domain-adversarial networks (D3AN) which combine convolutional neural networks (CNN) with domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) to perform cross-domain sentiment classification. We experiment with four data sets from related as well as unrelated domains (IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, Amazon and Twitter data sets)
